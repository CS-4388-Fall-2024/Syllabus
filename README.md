Office Hours: TBD

## Overview

Computer graphics is an exciting field within computer science that has a far-reaching impact on our daily lives, through applications in movies, games, art, design, education, science, and medicine. In this course, you will learn the fundamental concepts and programming techniques used in game development and other interactive computer graphics applications.  The core topics covered in this class include: 2D/3D graphics math, physical simulation, scene graph representations, polygonal modeling, texture mapping, character animation, illumination models, shader programming, ray casting, and projection.  

Although this is a programming-heavy course, it is designed to be accessible even if you don't have access to a computer with a powerful graphics card.  Programming assignments will be implemented in TypeScript using a high-level graphics toolkit built on top of WebGL, which will run inside the web browser on a wide range of hardware devices and operating systems.

## Learning Objectives

In this course, you will learn to:
- Understand basic concepts and algorithms relevant to computer graphics programming.
- Identify, define, and solve problems involving 2D and 3D computer graphics.
- Implement real-time computer graphics using a high-level scene graph library.
- Write shader programs that run on the graphics processing unit (GPU).
- Implement user interfaces for interacting with 3D graphics applications.

## Prerequisites

This is a programming-heavy course that assumes knowledge of concepts, algorithms, and data structures taught in previous computer science classes. TypeScript is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language that uses a syntax similar to Java and C#, but does not require explicit memory management like C++.  Prior experience with at least one of these object-oriented programming languages is recommended, but not strictly required. Please contact me if you have any questions about whether the course is a good fit for your interests and background.

## Course Structure and Modality

The course is divided into six **modules**, each of which lasts two weeks.  Generally, I will start each module with a class on graphics concepts, math, and techniques. These classes will generally follow a standard lecture format, but may also involve some in-class activities and discussion.  The lectures on conceptual material will be complemented with live programming sessions with me, which will typically during the second class of the module.  On these days, feel free to bring your laptops to class to follow along in real-time. Note that writing code during class is optional; you can also just watch and take notes. The live programming sessions have been very popular with students in the past, and gives me the opportunity to show you an expert in computer graphics goes about programming and problem solving. This is a great way to learn not only about graphics, but also about debugging, TypeScript syntax, and how to break a programming project into small steps.

During the second week of each module, we will often have a second lecture on more advanced concepts, followed by another live programming class.  However, the exact schedule may vary based on the content we need to cover, and sometimes it makes more sense to swap the order of the lecture and programming classes in a given week.

I intend to hold all class sessions **in-person**.  The class will not be live streamed except if situational factors arise, such as personal illness, in which case the class may be held synchronously via Zoom.   However, I recognize that in-person attendance is not always possible or practical.  Therefore, all classes will be **recorded**, and the videos will be posted on Canvas. Note that **you do not need to contact me** if you have to miss a class; just make sure to watch the video as soon as you can, so you don't fall behind.

## Textbook

There is no textbook for this course.  However, there will be online resources, articles, and tutorials posted on various computer graphics topics throughout the semester.  Students are expected to be familiar with this content in addition to the material covered in class.

## Assessments

There will be a total of six programming assignments in this class. Although they are challenging, they are also the most exciting and rewarding aspect of the course (and your chance to impress your friends with some cool 3D graphics). Your goal in these assignments should be to come away with a great practical understanding of how to tackle new computer graphics programming challenges using the modern programming toolkits.

Each assignment will be introduced at the beginning of a two-week module. At the end of the first week, you will complete the **Quiz**. This will review the key mathematical or algorithmic concepts in the assignment.  Quizzes will be administered **online** and are **open book**.  They will need to be completed before the deadline, but they otherwise have no time limit, and you have flexibility in choosing when to take it.  Note that the quizzes are designed to get you thinking about the assignment early, so it is generally a good idea to complete them before starting work on the program.

At the end of the second week, you will submit the **Program**. If you struggled with the quiz, then seek help from TAs as needed, and make sure that you understand the key concepts first. At a minimum, your goal should be to have a full understanding of the concepts and how you will solve the programming portion by the end of the first week. This way, you will be sure to have at least one full week to implement and debug the program.

Students enrolled in CS 5388 (graduate section) will have additional work to complete for each assessment. This extra work will include tasks designed to meet the higher expectations for graduate students, ensuring a deeper understanding and more advanced application of the course material.

### Class Participation

Certain classes, especially those involving live programming, will include a **participation exercise** that will need to be completed by the end of the module. These exercises are very short and meant to provide deeper engagement with the course concepts. All of the exercises will be submitted online, so you can complete them even if you watch the lecture video asynchronously. Completing the participation exercises will count for 10% of your final grade, and the **lowest two** will be dropped to allow for the occasional missed class.

## Grading

Final course grades will be calculated based upon the following percentages.
- Programs - 50%
- Quizzes - 20%
- Exam - 20%
- Participation - 10%

The grading in this course is on an absolute scale. This means that the performance of others in the class will not affect your grade. Letter grades will be assigned using the following scale:

- A  ≥ 93.0% 
- A-  ≥ 90.0% and < 93.0%
- B+ ≥ 87.0% and < 90.0%
- B  ≥ 83.0% and < 87.0%
- B-  ≥ 80.0% and < 83.0%
- C+ ≥ 77.0% and < 80.0%
- C  ≥ 73.0% and < 77.0%
- C-  ≥ 70.0% and < 73.0%
- D+ ≥ 67.0% and < 70.0%
- D  ≥ 60.0% and < 67.0%
- F   < 60.0%

For S/N grading, a satisfactory grade (S) requires a grade of 70.0% or above.

## Flexible Late Policy

This course has a flexible late policy. Each assignment will have a fixed due date, but each of you will be granted **7 late points** at the beginning of the semester.

Each late point is worth a 24-hour extension for any programming assignment. You are free to allocate them however you want throughout the course. For example, if you are sick, have a family emergency, or even just a big project due, you could apply all points to that assignment and hand it in a week late. Alternatively, you could decide to spread these days around and submit programming assignment a day or two late.

If you have late points remaining, **you do not need to contact me** for an extension on programming assignments. These extensions are applied automatically with no questions asked. When you submit your code using GitHub, the time is logged by the system. If the submission is late, we will apply an extension in the grading system and deduct the corresponding number of late points.

Your current late points will be visible in Canvas and will be updated when your assignments are graded. Note that you are responsible for keeping track of remaining points if you submitted an assignment late, but it has not been graded yet. If you run out of late points and anticipate further difficulties in completing work on time, then you should contact me to discuss your situation.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

*Do I have to tell you when I want to use my late points?*  
No, we will apply credit automatically. I understand that things happen, and everyone probably needs a day or two here and there, so just take them automatically if you need them. It’s fine as long as you don’t take so many up front that you fall terribly behind.

*Do these apply to the quizzes as well as the programming assignments?*  
Late points only apply to the programs. The quizzes are much shorter and worth less than the programming assignments. They can be completed anytime within the first week of the module, so you would need a very convincing justification for an additional extension. If you miss a quiz, you will have the opportunity to replace it by completing the bonus quiz at the end of the semester.

*What if I get really sick or something and need an extension beyond this?*  
That is possible in rare circumstances, but you need to talk with me about this situation. You can expect that the first thing I will ask is: How have you used the late points that I have already given you? That’s quite a lot already; are more really justified in this case?

*Is there a penalty if I run out of late points and submit an assignment after the deadline?*  
If you use all your late points, we will grade the assignment with a late penalty of 5% for each day it is late.

*If I don't use all my late points by the end of the semester, will I receive bonus points?*  
No. The late points are meant to increase equity for students that are disadvantaged in this course. If they were redeemable for bonus points, then this would effectively penalize the students who need extensions for legitimate reasons beyond their control. If this seems unfair to you, then please consider this explanation from the National Association of Colleges of Employers: "The term *equity* refers to fairness and justice and is distinguished from *equality*: Whereas equality means providing the same to all, equity means recognizing that we do not all start from the same place and must acknowledge and make adjustments to imbalances."

## Standard Policies

This class follows standard university policies. It's your responsibility to be familiar with:

- [Code of Student conduct](https://studenthandbook.txst.edu/rules-and-policies/code-of-student-conduct.html)
- [Academic honor code](https://studenthandbook.txst.edu/rules-and-policies/academic-honor-code.html)
- [Student handbook](https://studenthandbook.txst.edu/)
- [Grades and Changes of Grades](https://policies.txst.edu/division-policies/global/02-12.html)
- [Sexual misconduct policy ](https://docs.gato.txst.edu/322645/TSUS%20Sexual%20Misconduct%20Policy.pdf)

## Academic Integrity

First, please review the [Academic honor code](https://studenthandbook.txst.edu/rules-and-policies/academic-honor-code.html). The following describes how these policies specifically apply in this course. 

#### Collaboration Policy

All work submitted for this course is required to be your original work, except where specifically noted in the syllabus or the assignment description. In general, you are expected to do your own thinking, your own design, and your own implementation.

You are encouraged to discuss the content of the lectures and the texts with your peers. With respect to programming assignments, you are also permitted to discuss and make posts about programming in general (e.g., a syntax error you are stuck on, missing include file). However, your communication with others must stop before discussing a solution to the assignment. If you have any question about whether discussing something with peers might go beyond what is permitted, then stop and ask me for clarification on the policy.

####  Use of Web Resources

The web will be one of your best learning tools and sources of documentation for working with TypeScript and computer graphics toolkits used in the class, but you are not allowed to use web or other external resources to find solutions to the core computer graphics problems in your assignments.

**What you can do:**

- You are permitted to use course material without citation. This includes the lecture videos, slides, textbook, example code from class, official API documentation, and any other course material the instructor posts on Canvas. 
- You are permitted to use art assets (e.g., 3D models, textures, sound effects, etc.) from the internet in programming assignments. **However, you must cite all third-party assets in a readme file.** This citation must include a brief title or description of the specific assets used along with a link to wherever you found them.

**What you cannot do:**

- You are not allowed to search for solutions to assignments. For example, if your assignment is to develop your own texture mapping routine for a sphere, you can lookup the API documentation to learn the right function to call and the right syntax to use to set the texture coordinate for each vertex in a mesh. What you cannot do is google for “texture map a sphere” and find out how to setup a for loop and use cos() and sin() equations to determine the correct texture coordinates for each vertex of the sphere. This is the difference between using the web as a programming toolkit reference vs. using the web as a reference for the computer graphics algorithms/solutions that are being taught in the course. With the exception of the small snippets of code that are found in the official language or API documentation, you should never copy code like a routine, class, object, etc. from a website and include it in an assignment or project. 
- You are not allowed to ask other people to complete portions of an assignment or project for you. This includes classmates, friends, and use of paid services.
- You are **not allowed to use AI platforms** such as ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, Bing, or Microsoft Copilot to solve conceptual problems or generate code on quizzes or programming assignments.  While AI technologies can be powerful tools for experienced programmers, using them to complete coursework will undermine your learning.
- You are **not allowed to use AI programming plugins** such as GitHub Copilot. Once again, these tools are intended to help professional developers write code faster, but if you use them in this course, they may trivialize portions of the assignments and prevent you from learning the core concepts that a graphics programmer would be expected to understand.
- You cannot use third-party assets that violate license terms or the rights of the original author. For example, free art assets that are posted in a public forum or asset store are permissible. However, any commercial or copyrighted assets, such as 3D models available for purchase on an online store, must be obtained legitimately. In general, using someone's work without their consent is ethically wrong and will be considered academic dishonesty in this course.

#### Consequences of Academic Dishonesty

Academic dishonesty in this class will result in a 0 on the assignment or exam in question for the first offense, and an automatic F in the class for the second offense. All cases of academic dishonesty are required to be reported to the University Honor Code Council.

Remember, we are here to help you. If you have any questions about whether something counts as academic dishonesty, please ask me or the TAs for clarification!

## Mental Health Information

Texas State University strives to ensure all students have access to resources that will help them feel safe and supported. Your mental health is part of who you are and if you are unsure where to turn, we are here to help you. If you are encountering challenges, I encourage you to visit the [Counceling Center](https://www.counseling.txst.edu/) website and connect with one of our Mental Health Advocates, who are available to provide mental health resources and services.

## Disability Information

University policy is to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have documented disability conditions (e.g., physical, learning, psychiatric, vision, hearing, or systemic) that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the [Office of Disability Services](https://www.ods.txst.edu/) to discuss individual needs for accommodations.

If you have already been working with the Office of Disability Services and have a letter from them to help direct your instructors on to set you up for success, then please send that to me at the beginning of the semester. In many cases, you will find that this course is already designed to be accessible for students that would benefit from additional flexibility (e.g., non-timed quizzes, flexible late policy on programming assignments, etc.). However, if additional accommodations are necessary, I will make every reasonable effort to make sure this class is a good experience for you.
